# Purpose

Collection of helpful examples for me.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/konnorrogers/dagonruby-examples.git
cd dragonruby-examples
```

Now, with `dragonruby-examples` as the "current working directory", run the following script to copy your `dragonruby` binaries into the root of this repo.

```bash
./copy-dragonruby ~/Downloads/dragonruby-gtk-macos/dragonruby-macos/*
```

Alternatively, you can manually copy every file from Dragonruby into the root of this repo excluding "samples" and "mygame".

## Running a sample

```bash
cd ./examples/walking-character
./run
```

This will boot up dragonruby and you should see the sample running!

## Whats next?

I'll be adding examples as I find things worth adding while working with Dragonruby!
