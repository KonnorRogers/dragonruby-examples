# Purpose

Collection of helpful examples for me.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/konnorrogers/dagonruby-examples.git
cd dragonruby-examples
```

Now, with `dragonruby-examples` as the "current working directory", run the following script to copy your `dragonruby` binaries into the root of this repo.

```bash
./copy-dragonruby ~/Downloads/dragonruby-gtk-macos/dragonruby-macos/*
```
